#### About Me
I’m a **DevOps Engineer** with a strong focus on AWS, Linux, and automation.  
I build production-minded systems where **security, reliability, and clear architecture** are default, not afterthoughts.

I enjoy:
- designing cloud infrastructure that is actually operable
- automating away manual and repetitive work
- building systems that are easy to understand, scale, and maintain

**Fun fact:**  
My nickname is **sudo**, not because I overuse it, but because I actually got it from my uncle.  
**Sudo** is a popular nickname for the name Suad in Bosnia😄

#### Final Note
Never run this in production:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /
```
…but if you understand why this is a bad idea, we’ll probably get along just fine😉
